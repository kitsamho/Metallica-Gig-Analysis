 Better raise your ears
 The sound of hooves knock at your door
 Lock up your wife and children now
 It's time to wield the blade
 For now you have got some company

 The Horsemen are drawing nearer
 On leather steeds they ride
 They've come to take your life
 On through the dead of night
 With the Four Horsemen ride
 Or choose your fate and die

 You have been dying since the day you were born
 You know it has all been planned
 The quartet of deliverance rides
 A sinner once a sinner twice
 No need for confessions now
 Cause now you have got the fight of your life

 Has taken its toll on you
 The lines that crack your face
 Famine
 Your body it has torn through
 Withered in every place
 Pestilence
 For what you have had to endure
 And what you have put others through
 Death
 Deliverance for you for sure
 Now there is nothing you can do

 So gather round young warriors now
 And saddle up your steeds
 Killing scores with demon swords
 Now is the death of doers of wrong
 Swing the judgement hammer down
 Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

 The Horsemen are drawing nearer
 On leather steeds they ride
 They've come to take your life
 On through the dead of night
 With the Four Horsemen ride
 Or choose your fate and die

 Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate

 And I�d just ate
 A following heart can tear you apart
 On a midnight to 8 shift

 A graveyard romance can only give one chance
 As the tombstones weave and breathe

 Feeling happy when my heart got beating
 On a Sunday afternoon

 I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
 And stars were still illumed
 I have three hearts that I keep apart
 Trying to relate
 To normal feelings and the nightime reelings
 And some absynthe drunk so late

 The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
 Onto the size of dessert plates
 But me I�m happy cause I got my little nappy
 And some opium to set me straight
 I�m just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
 While my looks still hold me straight

 Straight up to illusion and fantasy�s fusion
 Of reality mixed with drink
